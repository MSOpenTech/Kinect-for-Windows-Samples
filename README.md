Kinect for Windows Samples
==========================


What is this?
-------------

This repository contains samples submitted by the Kinect for Windows Developer Community. Submitters intend to help fellow Developers hit the ground running while creating Kinect apps for Windows. Have you come up with a great sample app that deserves to be shared with the OSS community? This is the place to put it!



How do I get started?
-----------------

In order to build and use the samples you will need:

- A **Kinect for Windows V2 sensor**: you can either [order it online](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/kinectforwindows/) or purchase it at a Microsoft Store.
 
- **Kinect for Windows SDK V2**: download it from the [Kinect for Windows Developer page](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/kinectforwindows/develop/).
 
- **Visual Studio**: Samples build with [Visual Studio](http://www.visualstudio.com/) versions 2012 Express and above.



How can I contribute?
------------------- 

We encourage you to submit pull requests with bug fixes, enhancements as well as brand new samples to showcase how to include Kinect capabilities in Windows and Windows Phone apps.

The process to get them approved is super simple! Our reviewers go over new submissions on a weekly basis. If you are a new contributor, before we publish your code you will just have to fill in our [Contribution Agreement](https://cla.msopentech.com/) form. That's it! 

**Looking for ideas?**

Here are some examples for samples that might be interesting: 

- **Exercise recognition** – ask the user to move in a particular way and determine if the user actually did that. This can be useful in a home exercise app. 

- **Adaptive UI** – show how a UI can change based on distance from the sensor. For example, at 10 ft away, the UI shows a couple of large buttons to interact with. As the user moves closer, the UI changes to show content and support interactions that are more granular. The Adaptive UI sample in K4W v1.8 is a good starting point. 

- **Multi-user Engagement** – build an app that shows how to handle multiple bodies being detected, such that each can interact with the app without the app confusing them 

- **Real-world Object Interaction** (hotspot detection) – show how to use Kinect for Windows to detect when one object gets closer to another object in the real world.
